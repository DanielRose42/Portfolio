## Hi I'm Daniel Rose, a recent Physics Graduate from the University of Southampton (MPhys, First Class Honours).

As a hardworking and motivated individual I am enthusiastic in all I do. I am an inquisitive and passionate problem solver, able to synthesise information from a variety of sources and summarise the key elements in a concise and understandable way.

Through studying Physics I have attained an eye for detail and am able construct logical and reasoned arguments, and communicate these effectively across teams. I possess excellent technical and analytical skills, am proficient at modelling data using Python and am also adept at writing technical reports using LaTeX.

**I also received the award for the Best Masters Project across the entire MPhys course for the year 2018/19.**
